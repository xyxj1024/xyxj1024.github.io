I really like this analogy by [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) from his article ["How to Do Great Work"](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html):

> Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.

which reminds me of this [Branch Assignment](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse425s/index.php?title=Branch_Assignment) we did in the course CSE 425S at Washington University. To generate self-similar fractals, we take the recursive approach. Technically speaking, in regard to the functioning of any real-world system, economic or biological, "recursion" and "growth" are synonyms. To keep moving forward in the following four-step recursion:
1. Choose a field;
2. Learn enough to get to the frontier;
3. Notice gaps;
4. Explore promising ones,

one needs to work super hard with strong motivations.

> The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there is a whole world inside.
