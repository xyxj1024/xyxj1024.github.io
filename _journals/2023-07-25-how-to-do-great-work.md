I really like this analogy coined by [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) in his article ["How to Do Great Work"](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html):

> Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.

which reminds me of this [Branch Assignment](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse425s/index.php?title=Branch_Assignment) we did in the course CSE 425S at Washington University. To generate self-similar fractals, we take the recursive approach. Technically speaking, "recursion" and "growth" can be synonyms. To keep moving forward in the following four-step recursive process of personal growth:
1. Choose a field;
2. Learn enough to get to the frontier;
3. Notice gaps;
4. Explore promising ones,

one needs to work super hard with strong motivations.

> The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there is a whole world inside.

And every programmer should be intrigued by the following idea:

> Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.
>
> "Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.
