## XUANYUAN Xingjian (轩辕 行健)

Once thinking that I am destined for a career as a social scientist, right now I am a dedicated systems engineer. I believe that the practice of documenting, quietly promoting knowledge sharing and cultural understanding, defines the true essence of being human.

Supervisor: [Dr. Zhun Zhao](https://www.tioe.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1180/1309.htm)

> A Twitter thread by [@concodanomics](https://twitter.com/concodanomics): The repo market is the wheel greaser of the U.S. empire's financial engine. Without it, U.S. dollar liquidity would be lackluster. . . . On top, triparty repo allows cash lenders, mainly asset managers like MMFs, to lend mostly to the Fed's primary dealers, whose job is to distribute cash to other segments in repo. Primary dealers then attempt to make a profit by lending these funds into "interdealer" (dealer-to-dealer) markets and charging a higher spread. Smaller securities dealers will lend this cash to customers in the "bilateral" (dealer-to-customer) market, for an even larger fee.

  - Hand-collected and visualized macro-­financial data sets retrieved from official websites of FRB, New York Fed, St. Louis Fed, SEC, SIFMA, OFR, as well as multiple academic publications.
  - Explained market segmentation, (estimated) transaction volume, major participants, collateral types, rehypothecation, and contract features of tri-party repos in the U.S.
  - Recounted the origin, early developments, and 2007-2009 market run, emphasizing legal complexity, balance sheet effects, and systemic risk associated with repo transactions.
