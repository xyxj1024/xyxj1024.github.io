This is [the calendar assignment of Washington University CSE 503S: "Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming" Module 5](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse330/index.php/Module_5) (Spring 2023). The calendar service should:
- allow users to register, log in and out of the website;
- allow registered users to add events associated with certain dates and times, to only view, edit and delete their own events;
- utilize a database (e.g., MySQL) to keep all user and event data;
- utilize AJAX to run server-side scripts that query the database to save and retrieve information, including user accounts and events;
- support a month-by-month view of the calendar with buttons to move forward or backward.

User interactions at the web browser should be processed by JavaScript without ever refreshing the browser after the initial web page load.
