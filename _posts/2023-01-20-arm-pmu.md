Exercise 3, 4, and 5 from Washington University CSE 522S: "Advanced Operating Systems" Studio 3: "Hardware Counters and Loadable Kernel Modules". For Linux kernel version used in the course and Raspberry Pi configuration, please refer to [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/configure-compile-linux-kernel). A month ago, [I tried to get timing measurements from userspace on my Raspberry Pi]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/march-attacks-on-arm-part-1#replacing-__rdtscp), but failed. This post provides some sort of solution. Programs shown here are largely adapted from the starter code provided by [Dr. Marion Sudvarg](https://www.sudvarg.com/).

The Arm&reg; Cortex-A53 Performance Monitor Unit ("PMU" for short, a co-processor separate from the main processor) enables us to gather various statistics on the operation of the processor and its memory system during runtime. The PMU has $$32$$-bit counters that increment when they are enabled based on events and a $$64$$-bit cycle counter. The PMU counters and their associated control registers are accessible in the AArch32 Execution state from the internal `CP15` system register interface with `MCR` (move to co-processor from ARM register) and `MRC` (move to ARM register from co-processor) instructions for $$32$$-bit registers and `MCRR` and `MRRC` for $$64$$-bit registers.

The `PMCR` register controls accesses to the PMU in general:

|---
| **CRn** | **Op1** | **CRm** | **Op2** | **Name** | **Type** | **Width** | **Description**
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| `c9` | `0` | `c12` | `0` | `PMCR` | `RW` | $$32$$ | Performance Monitors Control Register

`PMUSERENR` is the User Enable Register that needs to be configured to allow user code to access the PMU:

|---
| **CRn** | **Op1** | **CRm** | **Op2** | **Name** | **Type** | **Width** | **Description**
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| `c9` | `0` | `c14` | `0` | `PMUSERENR` | `RW` | $$32$$ | Performance Monitors User Enable Register

These two registers are of particular interest. More implementation details can be found in [Arm&reg; Cortex-A53 MPCore Processor Technical Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0500/j/Performance-Monitor-Unit/) and [ARM Architecture Reference Manual &mdash; ARMv8, for ARMv8-A architecture profile](https://github.com/kn-gloryo/armv8a/blob/master/docs/ARM%20Architecture%20Reference%20Manual%20-%20ARMv8%2C%20for%20ARMv8-A%20architecture%20profile.pdf).

## Reading from Performance Monitors Cycle Count Register (`PMCCNTR`)

On x86 machines, we can directly access a Time Stamp Counter (`TSC`) register from userspace with the following code:

```c
static inline unsigned long long rdtsc_get(void) {
    unsigned long high, low;
    asm volatile ("rdtsc" : "=a" (low), "=d" (high));
    return ( (unsigned long long) low ) |
           ( ( (unsigned long long) high ) << 32 );
}
```

ARM also provides a cycle counter, the Performance Monitors Cycle Count Register (`PMCCNTR`) on the PMU, which is architecturally mapped to AArch64 System register `PMCCNTR_EL0`. `PMCCNTR` is a $$64$$-bit register that can also be accessed as a $$32$$-bit value. If it is accessed as a $$32$$-bit register, accesses read and write bits `[31:0]` and do not modify bits `[63:32]`. However, unlike the `TSC` register on x86, ARM's `PMCCNTR` register is not, by default, accessible from userspace. We have to write a kernel module to read its content. First, inside the directory that holds our out-of-tree kernel modules (`/project/scratch01/compile/x.xingjian/modules`), I created a C program named `ccnt_get_kernel.c` and a `Makefile` that contains the line:

```makefile
obj-m := ccnt_get_kernel.o
```

The `ccnt_get_kernel.c` program should be able to measure the elapsed times between reads from the `PMCCNTR` for $$100$$ samples, and reports the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the elapsed cycles between reads.

### Enable Cycle Count

The first thing we need to do is to set the Enable bit (`[0]`) of `PMCR`, which is a global counter enable bit. Then, the second thing we need to do is to enable the Cycle Count Register `PMCCNTR` by setting the Enable bit of `PMCNTENSET` (the Performance Monitors Count Enable Set register). Note that the value of `PMCCNTR` increments in one of the following ways:

- Every processor clock cycle.
- Every 64th processor clock cycle.

Writing `1` to the C bit (`[2]`) of `PMCR` sets the cycle count field to `0`. If `PMCCNTR` is accessed as a $$32$$-bit register, it can be read using `MRC <syntax>` and written using `MCR <syntax>`. The $$32$$-bit read syntax is as shown below:

|---
| **&lt;syntax&gt;** | **opc1** | **opc2** | **CRn** | **coproc** | **CRm**
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| `p15, 0, <Rt>, c9, c13, 0` | `000` | `000` | `1001` | `1111` | `1101`

If `PMCCNTR` is accessed as a $$64$$-bit register, it can be read using `MRRC <syntax>` and written using `MCRR <syntax>`. The $$64$$-bit read syntax is as shown below:

|---
| **&lt;syntax&gt;** | **opc1** | **coproc** | **CRm**
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| `p15, 0, <Rt>, <Rt2>, c9` | `0000` | `1111` | `1001`

The write syntax is as shown below:

|---
| **&lt;syntax&gt;** | **opc1** | **opc2** | **CRn** | **coproc** | **CRm**
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
| `p15, 0, <Rt>, c9, c12, 1` | `000` | `001` | `1001` | `1111` | `1100`

Here I include an implementation modified from Dr. Marion Sudvarg's driver code:

```c

}

{

    asm volatile ("MRC p15, 0, %0, c9, c12, 0\t\n" : "=r" (x));
    return x;
}

}

{
    unsigned long flags;
    flags = pmcr_get();
    if ( !(flags & PMCR_ENABLE_COUNTERS) )
        pmcr_enable_pmccntr(cycles_64_bit, count_every_64);;
    flags = cntens_get();
    if ( !(flags & CNTENS_CYCLE_CTR) )
        cntens_enable_pmccntr();
}
```

### Retrieve Cycle Count

Based on the aforementioned ARM assembly syntax, we can use the following function, which takes no arguments and returns a `uint64_t` value, to retrieve the CPU cycle counts:

```c
static inline long long pmccntr_get(void) {
    register unsigned long pmcr = pmcr_get();
    if(pmcr & PMCR_CYCLE_COUNTER_64_BIT) {
        unsigned long low, high;
        asm volatile ("MRRC p15, 0, %0, %1, c9" : "=r" (low), "=r" (high));
        return ( (unsigned long long) low ) |
               ( ( (unsigned long long) high ) << 32 );
    } else {
        unsigned long cycle_count;
        asm volatile ("MRC p15, 0, %0, c9, c13, 0" : "=r" (cycle_count));
        return (unsigned long long) cycle_count;
    }
}
```

### Math in the Kernel

For calculating the mean and standard deviation, we will likely need to use $$64$$-bit division and a square-root function. The cross-compiler we use in the course may not be able to generate the correct operations for $$64$$-bit division on the target $$32$$-bit platform. In his famous *Linux Kernel Development*, Robert Love wrote:

> When a userspace process uses floating-point instructions, the kernel manages the transition from integer to floating point mode. What the kernel has to do when using floating-point instructions varies by architecture, but the kernel normally catches a trap and then initiates the transition from integer to floating point mode.
> 
> Unlike userspace, the kernel does not have the luxury of seamless support for floating point because it cannot easily trap itself. Using a floating point inside the kernel requires manually saving and restoring the floating point registers, among other possible chores. The short answer is: Don't do it! Except in the rare cases, no floating-point operations are in the kernel.

For $$64$$-bit division, we can use the `div_u64()` function declared in `<linux/math64.h>`:

```c
static inline u64 div_u64(u64 dividend, u32 divisor)
{
    u32 remainder;
    return div_u64_rem(dividend, divisor, &remainder);
}
```

For calculating a power of any given $$64$$-bit number, we can use the `int_pow()` function; for an integer approximation of the square root, we can use the `int_sqrt()` or `int_sqrt64()` function. Both of them are declared in `<linux/kernel.h>`:

```c
u64 int_pow(u64 base, unsigned int exp);
unsigned long int_sqrt(unsigned long);

#if BITS_PER_LONG < 64
u32 int_sqrt64(u64 x);
#else
static inline u32 int_sqrt64(u64 x)
{
    return (u32)int_sqrt(x);
}
#endif
```

Finally, my kernel module code looks like this:

```c
/* ccnt_get_kernel.c */
static bool cycles_64_bit = 1;
static bool count_every_64 = 0;

static uint64_t elapse[100];

static void enable_ccnt(void *info)
{
    pmccntr_enable_once(cycles_64_bit, count_every_64);
}

static void ccnt_get(void)
{
    uint64_t t1 = 0, t2 = 0, min = 32768, max = 0, sum = 0, mean = 0;
    unsigned long sd = 0, ssq = 0;
    unsigned int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        t1 = pmccntr_get(); t2 = pmccntr_get();
        if (t2 > t1) {
            elapse[i] = t2 - t1;
            if (elapse[i] < min) {
                min = elapse[i];
            }
            if (elapse[i] > max) {
                max = elapse[i];
            }
        } else {
            /* skip if overflow */
            i--;
        }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum += elapse[i];
    }
    mean = div_u64(sum, (uint32_t)100);
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        ssq += int_pow((elapse[i] - mean), 2);
    }
    sd = int_sqrt(div_u64((uint64_t)ssq, (uint32_t)100));
    printk(KERN_INFO "Minimum and maximum of the elapsed cycles: %llu, %llu\n", min, max);
    printk(KERN_INFO "Average of the elapsed cycles: %llu\n", mean);
    printk(KERN_INFO "Standard deviation of the elapsed cycles: %lu\n", sd);
}

static int ccnt_get_init(void) {
    on_each_cpu(enable_ccnt, NULL, 0);
    printk(KERN_INFO "Cycle Counter Enabled\n"); ccnt_get();
    return 0;
}

static void ccnt_get_exit(void) {

}

module_init(ccnt_get_init);
module_exit(ccnt_get_exit);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Xingjian Xuanyuan");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Studio 3");
```

To build the module, issue the command:
```bash
LINUX_SOURCE=/project/scratch01/compile/x.xingjian/linux_source/linux
```
Compile the module via:
```bash
make -C $LINUX_SOURCE ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- M=$PWD modules
```
which, if successful, should produce a kernel module file named `ccnt_get_kernel.ko`. Transfer this file to the Raspberry Pi using `sftp`. Use the `insmod` utility to load this module into the kernel:
```bash
sudo insmod ccnt_get_kernel.ko
```
To confirm the module was successfully loaded, issue the command:
```bash
lsmod
```
to see a listing of all currently loaded kernel modules. To unload the module, issue the command:
```bash
sudo rmmod enable_ccnt_522.ko
```

Finally, we can view the kernel log:

```console
$ dmesg | tail
[  569.358298] enable_ccnt_522: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.
[  569.358779] Cycle Counter Enabled
[  569.358807] Minimum and Maximum of the elapsed cycles: 10, 27
[  569.358818] Average of the elapsed cycles: 10
[  569.358830] Standard deviation of the elapsed cycles: 1
```

## Accessing the PMU from Userspace

The ARM PMU has a register, the Performance Monitor User Enable Register (`PMUSERENR`), that, when set, allows direct access to the PMU from userspace. We need the following function to configure it:

```c
static inline void pmccntr_enable_once_user(bool cycles_64_bit, bool count_every_64) {
    pmccntr_enable_once(cycles_64_bit, count_every_64);
    asm volatile ("MCR p15, 0, %0, c9, c14, 0" :: "r" (1));
}
```

Calling this function inside the `enable_ccnt()` function rather than `pmccntr_enable_once()`, our module should still be loaded correctly.

Moreover, the following userspace program calls the `pmccntr_get()` function directly:

```c
/* ccnt_get_user.c */
static bool cycles_64_bit = 1;
static bool count_every_64 = 0;

static unsigned long long elapse[100];

static void enable_ccnt(void) {
    pmccntr_enable_once(cycles_64_bit, count_every_64);
}

static void ccnt_get(void)
{
    unsigned long long t1 = 0, t2 = 0, min = 32768, max = 0, sum = 0;
    double mean = 0.0, sd = 0.0, ssq = 0.0;
    unsigned int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        t1 = pmccntr_get();
        t2 = pmccntr_get();
        if (t2 > t1) {
            elapse[i] = t2 - t1;
            if (elapse[i] < min) {
                min = elapse[i];
            }
            if (elapse[i] > max) {
                max = elapse[i];
	        }
        } else {
            /* skip if overflow */
            i--;
        }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum += elapse[i];
    }
    mean = sum / (double)100;
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        ssq += pow((elapse[i] - mean), 2);
    }
    sd = sqrt(ssq / (double)100);
    printf("Minimum and Maximum of the elapsed cycles: %lld, %lld\n", min, max);
    printf("Average of the elapsed cycles: %.4lf\n", mean);
    printf("Standard deviation of the elapsed cycles: %.4lf\n", sd);
}

int main()
{
    enable_ccnt();
    ccnt_get();

    return 0;
}
```

Make sure to include the driver file and `<stdbool.h>`. To compile this program, issue the command:

```bash
gcc ccnt_get_user.c -o ccnt_get_user -lm
```

Here is the output results:

```console
$ ./ccnt_get_user
Minimum and Maximum of the elapsed cycles: 48, 159
Average of the elapsed cycles: 49.1800
Standard deviation of the elapsed cycles: 11.0593
```

We can see that the values are similar to the previous exercise except that standard deviation is significantly larger.

## Using the `perf_event_open()` Syscall

The Linux kernel provides indirect access to hardware counters, including the ARM PMU, via the [`perf_event_open()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html) system call with system call number defined in `/arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h`:

```c
#define __NR_perf_event_open 364
__SYSCALL(__NR_perf_event_open, sys_perf_event_open)
```

Because `glibc` provides no wrapper for this function, it must be called directly with `syscall()`. System calls are very dependent on architecture, both in how they are invoked as well as what calls are available to be made. These are some of the files essential to the `perf_event_open()` syscall on the ARM architecture:

- The [`include/linux/syscalls.h`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.17/source/include/linux/syscalls.h) file provides architecture independent forward declarations of all kernel system calls. This is the kernel's internal interface to system call functions.
- The [`arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.17/source/arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h) file provides ARM architecture specific definitions of system call numbers.
- The [`arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.17/source/arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S) file provides the ARM architecture specific entry point for system calls.
- The [`arch/arm/tools/syscall.tbl`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.17/source/arch/arm/tools/syscall.tbl) file installs system call numbers and associated function addresses into the ARM hardware's system call table.
- The [`kernel/events/core.c`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.17/source/kernel/events/core.c#L11618) file defines the `perf_event_open()` syscall.

Measured [performance events](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.17/source/include/linux/perf_event.h#L625) come in two flavors: counting and sampling. A **counting** event is one that is used for counting the aggregate number of events that occur. In general, counting event results are gathered with a `read()` call. A **sampling** event periodically writes measurements to a buffer that can then be accessed via `mmap()`.

```c
/**
 * sys_perf_event_open - open a performance event, associate it to a task/cpu
 *
 * @attr_uptr:  event_id type attributes for monitoring/sampling
 * @pid:        target pid
 * @cpu:        target cpu
 * @group_fd:   group leader event fd
 */
SYSCALL_DEFINE5(perf_event_open,
                struct perf_event_attr __user *, attr_uptr,
                pid_t, pid, int, cpu, int, group_fd, unsigned long, flags) { ... }
```

When the `pid` argument is zero and the `cpu` argument is minus one (`pid == 0 && cpu == -1`), the syscall measures the calling process/thread on any CPU. A single event on its own is created with `group_fd == -1` and is considered to be a group with only one member.

In this exercise, we are asked to create a program directly on the Raspberry Pi that uses this syscall to get a file descriptor which, when read, supplies the current value of the `PMCNTR` register. [This Arm&reg; blog post](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/embedded-blog/blog/using-the-arm-performance-monitor-unit-pmu-linux-driver) provides some helpful instructions. Use `PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES` as the `config` field of the `perf_event_attr` argument to the syscall. Then, similarly to the previous exercises, take $$100$$ samples of the elapsed cycles between two subsequent `read`s, then have our program print the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of these samples.

My code looks like this:
